### Hi, I'm Aupala


I'm a results-driven Business Analyst with over 3 years of experience in data analytics, reporting automation, and process optimization. Currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at the Wisconsin School of Business, I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions.

My background spans global supply chain analytics, marketing data analysis, and predictive modeling. I’ve built and deployed full-stack ETL pipelines on AWS, developed Power BI dashboards to optimize procurement strategies, and used SQL, Python, and Excel to streamline workflows and enhance data accuracy.

## 🔍 What I’m Working On
- Uploading and documenting my **analytics projects** across ML, cloud, SQL, and RPA.
- Designing a **portfolio website** to complement my GitHub.
